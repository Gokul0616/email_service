# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## Summary of Email Authentication Improvements Made

The user reported an email authentication error when trying to send emails to Gmail. The error indicated:
- DKIM authentication failed
- SPF authentication failed  
- Gmail requires proper authentication (SPF or DKIM)

### Fixes Implemented:

1. **Improved DKIM Signing**:
   - Updated `sign_email_with_dkim()` to use sender's domain instead of hardcoded domain
   - Now extracts domain from sender email for proper authentication

2. **Enhanced Message Building**:
   - Updated `build_authenticated_message()` to use sender domain for Message-ID and authentication
   - Improved email headers for better deliverability

3. **Added Authentication Checker**:
   - New API endpoint `/api/auth-check/{domain}` to check domain authentication status
   - Checks for existing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Provides setup instructions and authentication status

4. **Improved Email Sending API**:
   - Added authentication guidance in error messages
   - Better validation and error handling for sender domains
   - Warns users about using major email providers as sender domains

5. **Enhanced Frontend**:
   - New "Auth Check" tab to check domain authentication status  
   - Authentication tips and warnings in Send Email tab
   - Visual indicators for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC status
   - Setup instructions and guidance

6. **Created Email Authentication Guide**:
   - Comprehensive guide explaining why emails are rejected
   - Step-by-step setup instructions for DNS records
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Alternative solutions for testing and production

### Root Cause of the Error:
The error occurs because major email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) require:
1. **Proper domain ownership** - Can't send FROM their domains without their SMTP servers
2. **DNS authentication records** - SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records must be configured
3. **Valid sender domain** - Must use a domain you own and control

### Solution for the User:
1. **Use your own domain** for the "from" email address (not Gmail/Yahoo)
2. **Set up DNS records** using the "DNS Setup" tab in the application
3. **Verify authentication** using the "Auth Check" tab
4. **Wait for DNS propagation** (24-48 hours)
5. **Test sending** from your authenticated domain

The email service system is working correctly - the issue is with email authentication setup, which is now properly addressed with the new tools and guidance provided.
